# Procedure: Define Product Requirements

This procedure outlines the steps to transform an initial user drafted intent into structured requirement files within the `.spec/facade/prd` directory.

## Steps

1.  **Analyze Initial Intent:**
    *   Start with the raw user intent documented in [`@initial.mdc`](mdc:@initial.mdc).
    *   Thoroughly read and understand the user's goals, desired features, and constraints.

2.  **Structure the Intent:**
    *   Refine the raw intent into a more structured format suitable for a Product Requirements Document (PRD).
    *   Identify key actors, use cases, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.
    *   Clarify ambiguities and fill in missing details, potentially requiring further interaction or assumptions (document assumptions clearly).

3.  **Decompose into Requirements:**
    *   Break down the structured intent into smaller, specific, and actionable requirement items.
    *   Group related requirements logically (e.g., by feature, module, user story).

4.  **Create PRD Files:**
    *   For each logical grouping identified in the previous step, create a corresponding markdown file within the `.spec/facade/prd/` directory.
    *   Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `feature-x.mdc`, `user-authentication.mdc`).
    *   Populate each file with the relevant requirement items, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and testability.
    *   Include context, rationale, acceptance criteria, and any relevant diagrams or mockups if available.

5.  **Review and Validate:**
    *   Review the generated files in `.spec/facade/prd/` against the original intent in [`@initial.mdc`](mdc:@initial.mdc).
    *   Ensure all aspects of the initial intent have been captured accurately and completely.
    *   Verify that the requirements are consistent, achievable, and well-defined. Iterate on the files as needed based on the review.

## Inputs

*   [`@initial.mdc`](mdc:@initial.mdc): File containing the initial, drafted user intent.

## Outputs

*   A set of markdown files within the `.spec/facade/prd/` directory, each detailing specific requirements derived from the initial intent.
