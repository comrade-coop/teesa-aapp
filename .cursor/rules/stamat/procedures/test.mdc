When testing and and debugging follow this procedure:
1. Run the relevant tests using [run_tests.sh](mdc:tests/run_tests.sh)
2. Identify the test suite which has the fewest amount of fails and/or is easiest to fix
3. Include the source files involved in this test and all their local dependencies (within our code, no libs)
4. Analythe why the test is failing and prepare a plan how to fix it. Determine if the problem is in the test or in the code being tested. 
5. Implement the fix
6. Run the test again the test to check if the fix worked
7. Itrerate over all fails from easy to hard, until all tests pass

Rules:
- Always use the provided [run_tests.sh](mdc:tests/run_tests.sh) script
- Always run the tests in debug and verbose mode (run_tests.sh -d -v)
- When debugging a specific issue, run only the relevant test
