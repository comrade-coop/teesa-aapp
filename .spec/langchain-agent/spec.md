# Executive Summary
Refactor the Teesa word game engine to use a Langchain agent for natural conversation while maintaining core game mechanics through specialized tools.

# Functional Requirements

## Langchain Tools

### Word Answer Tool
- **Function**: Evaluate yes/no questions about the secret word
- **Input**: Question string
- **Output**: Boolean
- Must use Ollama for inference
- Must maintain secret word security within TEE
- Must handle common-sense logic about word properties

### Word Guess Tool
- **Function**: Verify if a guess matches the secret word
- **Input**: Guessed word string
- **Output**: Boolean
- Must use Ollama for inference
- Must handle synonyms and variations
- Must maintain secret word security within TEE

## Langchain Agent
- Must embody Teesa's personality and role as game host
- Must maintain conversation context and game state
- Must detect and prevent repeated questions
- Must recognize and process:
  - Questions about the secret word
  - Direct guesses
  - Off-topic conversation
- Must steer conversation back to game objectives
- Must provide natural, engaging responses
- Must enforce game rules through conversation

## Game State Integration
- Must maintain existing game state management
- Must track conversation history
- Must handle winner detection
- Must trigger NFT generation on correct guess
- Must support game reset functionality
- Must integrate with existing UI components

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Security
- Maintain TEE security for secret word
- Ensure Ollama integration remains within secure context
- Preserve wallet and NFT security features

## Performance
- Optimize Langchain agent response time
- Minimize latency in tool execution
- Efficient context management

## Maintainability
- Clear separation between agent and tools
- Documented tool interfaces
- Configurable agent parameters
- Testable components

# Implementation Guidelines

## Tool Development
- Extract core logic from existing getAnswer() and checkGuess()
- Create Langchain-compatible tool wrappers
- Maintain Ollama integration
- Add comprehensive error handling

## Agent Configuration
- Define clear prompt template for Teesa's personality
- Set up conversation memory management
- Configure tool usage patterns
- Implement conversation steering logic

## Integration
- Adapt existing interfaces to work with Langchain
- Preserve game state management
- Maintain UI component compatibility
- Update history tracking for new conversation format

# Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual tools
- Integration tests for agent-tool interaction
- Conversation flow testing
- Game rule enforcement validation
- Security boundary testing

This specification provides a comprehensive framework for refactoring the word game engine while maintaining its core functionality and enhancing the user experience through more natural conversation flow.
